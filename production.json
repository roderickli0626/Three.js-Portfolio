By interpreting live data from an online database, earthquakes can be displayed on a three-dimensional model of the area. If high seismic activity occurs, the surface of the object begins to move accordingly and the magnitude is displayed in a graphical representation. In this way, viewers can monitor the seismic activity and are given an understanding of the scientific research work.","_type":"text-field","_key":"ca46d5c08157"},{"_type":"product-image","_key":"b784bc00980f","asset":{"_ref":"image-3f6530952d4b30cb58a66375a180ddb0cf95db8d-1920x1403-jpg","_type":"reference"}},{"_type":"product-image","_key":"c7b99d1672ff","asset":{"_ref":"image-9c6b092c8ec231cb8b0675e483dbee407efe6a0d-1080x925-jpg","_type":"reference"}}],"order":1},{"_type":"project","_id":"b9bdc69f-15f0-4b63-956c-4fada6488980","_updatedAt":"2022-09-23T16:13:48Z","sections":[{"input":"With the rise of Artificial Intelligence in recruitment, more and more job applications are evaluated by automated systems.","_type":"text-field","_key":"b414deac4bee"},{"_type":"product-image","_key":"d9484e4cb259","asset":{"_ref":"image-a364f33557bbfbbc4e92bec90cc9858ac3da98fd-1920x1280-jpg","_type":"reference"}},{"_type":"subheadline","_key":"e0f0d4c8a2dc","input":"Challenge"},{"input":"Job applicants who are directly impacted by AI hiring decisions do not get to understand, question or contest the results.
